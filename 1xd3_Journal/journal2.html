        My portfolio design from last week has improved a lot. Even in just one
        week I feel I learned so much more about web development and design, and
        that reflects through my updated portfolio. However, I still feel like I
        have a lot of room to grow. My website right now is much more intuitive
        and minamilistic (which I like), but It still feels like it missing
        something. I feel much more comfortable designing web pages, but
        somethign I need to learn more about is code organiziation. With HTML
        and CSS there is so much similar looking elements that make it hard to
        track in a big document. In other languages there is ways to organize
        the code and increase its readability and I want to learn little tips
        regarding that before next lab. Will update next journal, until next
        time.
