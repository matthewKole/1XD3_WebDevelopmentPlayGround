      My portfolio design from last week has improved a lot. Even in just one
      week I feel I learned so much more about web development and design, and
      that reflects through my updated portfolio. However, I still feel like I
      have a lot of room to grow. My website right now is much more intuitive
      and minamilistic (which I like), but It still feels like it missing
      something. I feel much more comfortable designing web pages, but somethign
      I need to learn more about is code organiziation. With HTML and CSS there
      is so much similar looking elements that make it hard to track in a big
      document. In other languages there is ways to organize the code and
      increase its readability and I want to learn little tips regarding that
      before next lab. Will update next journal, until next time.
