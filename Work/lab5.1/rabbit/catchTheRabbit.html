Try to turn this into a "catch the rabbit" game where the rabbit appears to 
"move" one space to the right whenever you mouse over it. After 4 attempts 
to mouse over, it should show the "No Easter Eggs" message. After 20 attempts, 
it should show "Humans are slow!!!". Put all your code in a .js file that is
loaded from the <head> element.

You can alter the CSS you have been given, but not the HTML.

Try to keep your JavaScript code economical (i.e., don't write more code
or create more functions than absolutely necessary.)

Hint: Make the rabbit "move" by hiding and showing images. Use CSS 
visibility:hidden and visibility:visible to hide/show the rabbit images as
necessary. The visibility property hides an element without removing it from 
the page, so the page layout is not altered. In contrast, display: none removes 
it from the page completely and can cause the page layout to change.
